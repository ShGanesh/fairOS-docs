FairOS-dfs release 0.6.2 will only work on bee version 0.6.2 or more. 

If you are using bee version less than 0.6.2, please resort to FairOS-dfs version less than 0.6.2. 

This is because of a breaking change in bee APIs in version 0.6.2 plus.

Hello and welcome to the [FairOS](/docs/fairOS/introduction), The missing Operating System (OS) for a Fair Data Society. FairOS is a project being done under the banner of [Fair Data Society](https://fairdatasociety.org/) (FDS).

###  What is FairOS
Think of Internet as a big computer, FairOS is poised to be the De-centalised OS that manages the resources of the computers in its network, like storage and compute. The nodes that run FairOS will be part of the global network that will run applications which can make use of the storage and compute that is available. It consists of two layers, namely FairOS-dfs(storage) and FairOS-compute(compute).

### Why FairOS?
FairOS is designed such that a user can run Apps/Dapps over the internet (like any cloud application) but still own and control all his data. Both data and compute are de-centralised, censorship resistance and follows the blueprint of web 3.0 and [fair data principles](https://principles.fairdatasociety.org/). Since all the data of a user is stored in a single logical place, data can be shared between the applications. Its like having all the benifits of running an application in cloud, but the user has absolute control over his data.

Also FairOS-dfs makes building a Dapp on top of easier by exposing File system and Database like contructs. If a developer moves from web 2.0 to web 3.0, FairOS-dfs will make sure he feels at home by providing similar storage tools that he/she is used to in web2.0. 

### FairOS ![alt text](/img/favicon.ico "") and Swarmüêù
The storage layer of FairOS, the Decentralised File System(dfs) uses Swarm as the base storage therby inheriting all the benefits of Swarm. On top of that, it builds other storage business logic, to expose things needed for an application to run. Think of Swarm as the device driver of the hard disk inside your laptop and FairOs-dfs as the Ext4 file system and other databases that run on top of it, except that FairOS-dfs does this for a group of computers instead of one.  

### How far is the development of FairOS
Right now the team is concentrating on building FairOS-dfs, the storage layer of FairOS. FairOS-dfs is in Beta release now and applications can make use of its storage capabilities by installing it alongside Swarm. FairOS-compute is still in the research stage and we will keep you updated.

### Installation
Don't have FairOS-dfs installed yet? It's easy! Head over to the [installation](/docs/fairOS-dfs/manual-installation) section to get FairOS up and running on your computer.

### Are any Dapps using FairOS now?
Yes. Fairdrive is a live and kicking Dapp that runs on top of FairOS-dfs. It is a Personal Data Store(PDS) which is used to store
- Personal Files of the user (like a de-centralised Dropbox)
- Application data, of any Dapp that uses Fairdrive connect, a javascript library
And many more on the development. 
Some of the Dapps which we want the web3.0 developer community to help are
- 

### API Reference
To learn more about how to get the most out of FairOS, head over to the [tutorials](/docs/getting-started/upload-and-download) section to find out how to create logical drives to store data, share file with your friends, Use a data store like Key Value Database or Document Database, and much much more...

### Development
We'd love you to join us! Are you up to the challenge of helping us to create FairOS and the other incredible technologies we're building on top of it? You are invited to contribute code to the FairOS-dfs or build any other Dapp on using it.

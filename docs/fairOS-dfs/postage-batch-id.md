Postage stamps are a concept used in Swarm network to pre-pay for storage of content by peers. After purchasing a batch of postage stamps through the Swarm Bee node interface, a reference to it is returned. By using this reference, uploads to Swarm network are possible, until the batch is depleted.

Remember to start a FairOS-dfs server with a parameter referring to the reference of a postage stamp.

More detailed information about postage stamps is available in [Swarm documentation](https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/access-the-swarm/keep-your-data-alive).
